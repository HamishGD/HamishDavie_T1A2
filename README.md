Description of Portfolio Website:
This website was designed in mind to be simple & easy to use, with clear responsiveness on screen sizes from mobile - tablet - desktop.

PURPOSE: It's purpose is to demonstrate the skills I've learnt so far in this Web Development Bootcamp and to be a 'jumping off point' for me to 
be able to create a strong portfolio website to show future employers.

FUNCTIONALITY & FEATURES: It has full functionality and it's features include four differnet pages (home, about, work & blogs) with text, images and 
color design suited to a beginner portfolio website submission. I also ensured text when displayed on desktop was nice & big; particularly helpful for those who need visual assistance. 

SITEMAP: The sitemap starts at the main page - the homepage, before linking to it's three subsquent (lower) pages - about, work & blogs.
(see Sitemap picture for short demostration)

SCREENSHOTS: (see Screenshots pictures of site)

TARGET AUDIENCE: The target audience for this portfolio website is ultimately any potential future employers. However, this project was designed as a beginner's porfolio website in mind, and as such will need to be updated and modified extensively to suit professional standards.

TECH STACK: I utilised HTML & CSS only throughout the building process of this portfolio website, before deploying to Netlify. My future professional porfolio website will include a far wider variety of tools including javascript and more extensive html & css practices.
