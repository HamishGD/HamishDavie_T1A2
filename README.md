Description of Portfolio Website:
This website was designed in mind to be simple & easy to use, with clear responsiveness on screen sizes from mobile - tablet - desktop.

**PURPOSE:** It's purpose is to demonstrate the skills I've learnt so far in this Web Development Bootcamp and to be a 'jumping off point' for me to 
be able to create a strong portfolio website to show future employers.

**FUNCTIONALITY & FEATURES:** It has full functionality and it's features include four differnet pages (home, about, work & blogs) with text, images and 
color design suited to a beginner portfolio website submission. I also everything is super responsive, adpating to any screen size and everything nice & big - especially on tablet & desktop, particularly helpful for those who need visual assistance. 

**SITEMAP:** The sitemap starts at the main page - the homepage, before linking to it's three subsquent (lower) pages - about, work & blogs.
(see Sitemap picture for short demostration)

**SCREENSHOTS:** (included in IMG folder)

**TARGET AUDIENCE:** The target audience for this portfolio website has been broken into two parts. The first - it is a sample portfolio which could potentially be shown towards potential employers (although a lot more work would be needed). The second, I wanted this website to be a STRONG focus for the visually impaired. This is the reason for the clear responsive nature of the website, with it's big text, pictures and emphasis on bright colors. Bright colors such as orange, pink and white (on a dark background) are some of the best colors for people with visual impairments (Duffy, 2021). This is the main reason I have designed the portfolio this way (on a personal note; I have an family member who is old and visually impaired and I wanted to create something that I could show them that they would enjoy).

This project however, as mentioned, was predominately designed as a beginner portfolio project and as such will need to be updated and modified extensively to suit professional standards.

**TECH STACK:** I utilised HTML & CSS only throughout the building process of this portfolio website, before deploying to Netlify. My future professional porfolio website will include a far wider variety of tools including javascript and more extensive html & css practices.
